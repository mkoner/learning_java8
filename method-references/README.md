## Method references

We use lambda expressions to create anonymous methods
We can use Method references to call methods that have a name.
Method references help to point to methods by their names. A method reference is described using "::" symbol.

Types of Method References:

1.Reference to a static method.
   ContainingClass::staticMethodName

2.Reference to an instance method.
   containingObject::instanceMethodName
3.Reference to a constructor.
   ClassName::new
